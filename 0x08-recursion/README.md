# Recusrion in C
## what is recursion?
Recursion is a programming concept in which a function calls itself to solve a problem.
Theese functions calls itself as apart of the execution.
#### Recursive functions have two main components
1. Base case: condition in which a function stops calling itself. It is the simplest form of the problem that can be solved without recursion. 
2. recursive case: This is the function where it calls itself with modified arguments to solve smaller subproblem.
Without Base case, Recursive function will call itself indefinately and it will leaf to runtime error (stack overflow)
